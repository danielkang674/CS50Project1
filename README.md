# Project 1

Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

Created a library app that allows users to register, sign in, search for books, see the book's information, and write reviews.
Also created an API that accepted GET requests using a book's ISBN number and return a JSON of that book's information.

import.py will import 5000 books into the SQL database.

books.csv contains 5000 books and their title, author, and publication year.

application.py is the backend server handling the routes and database calls.

templates folder contains all of the views and html files.

static folder contains the JavaScript file that dynamically creates the login and sign up forms.
